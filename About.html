          High school was not the best four years of my life like they say in
          the movies. There were many events during those four years where I

          much I hated school and felt like I was never appreciated for the
          person I am.

          Was what a guidance counsellor told me in high school during one of
          the most traumatic experiences that had ever occurred. In these
          moments I never thought I’d make it over the bridge of my own
          challenges. I turned to art when I felt alone, I let every paint
          stroke, stutter, pencil marks, showcase my stories.

          younger me pleading for the older me to find her sanctuary. She would
          be proud with our progress and the exquisite works of art we are able

          In the first month of grade 12 I was admitted to the hospital for a
          month and some change. This was the downfall yet the spark to my

          was restricted by the four walls around me with only my mom, nurses,

          I had my iPad, laptop, and sketchbook to keep me from loosing my
          sanity. That month I have never drawn or created digital art more. I’d
          say more than I have done compared to thus far in university. I made
          hard times easy having art with me. Days would go by in the hospital
          and I started to translate that into real-life. This became a valuable
          perspective I carry on in my day-to-day life as I appreciated the art
          around me. Whether that was outside, literature in books, or the small
          drawing I made on a napkin.
